# introduction
I think it s time to start a long term time capsule.
A deliberate rosetta stone in Chinese, Spanish, English and Dutch. ( I am Dutch, no other reason than that)

## doom or duty?
It seemeslogical that we are living in "end times". this might just be a psychological phenomenon.
There is a 6000 year old text of a egyptian priest thinking the same, there is Seneca, complaining
about the slipping morals.. "kids these days..." only these day is 2000 years ago.
There is the idea of the Kalpa´s of the hindu´s. 
Who think everything is getting worse and that is
as it should be. 
the Kali Juga is an old concept, according to hindu´s there is cycles of running down
taking 432.000.000 million years. This is posibly not meant as an exact numer, just as umpteen..
Big and unknowable.. But in their view, the end-times, the Kali Juga, only takes a 16th of this total period.
We know things end and we know entropy increases (second law of thermodynamics) and only antifragile structures last
a while ( millions of years is still a while on this scale), 
like the DNA of ants. This structure expresses, adapts ( a bit ) and reproduces. This is antifragility.
And have been doing it for millions of years.
As of yet there is no means of making information antifragile.
Books may be reprinted, open source may be a bit anttifragile, but both of these rely on a society, 
which relies on human DNA expressing. And are more to be seen as a weakest link in that chain.
We have lost more information as a human race than is imaginable. we exit for about 4 million years
and know only a little bit of the last 3000 years,

We face real extinction level events or fear them and are progressing towards them seemingly without thinking
like artificial intelligence, our disease control by shunning disease and death into colonies, like old people homes
and hospitals, even though we know, these are like a petri dish for breeding new deadly diseases. We explore
new and exciting ways to create zoonoses, invading further and further in every corner of the world.
There is a climate change brewing, not the political one, but the interglacial of the holocene.
Several iceages will follow us and each time a heatwave will have driven humans further north. or maybe we
will just slowly migrate, like birds do every year, we might do over thousands of years.
However.. one thing is certain, this point in time won´t last. There is a 50% chance things will get worse.
In case things are better, we will still be interesting as a data point.
Honest, long term non-political driven timecapsules seem our duty, no matter what.

## how to preserve
I think the best (most cost effective) way is to write, inscribe by hand on thick (0.5mm) aluminium sheets
deformations in aluminium are easy to make by hand (writing) and survive many temperature flucutations.
Then cotton balls (acid free)
Then acid free cardboard box(es)

put the sheets in paper boxes to keep them  temperature stable/isolated, the acid in the paper will eat away at the aluminium over millions of year so acid free (https://www.preservationequipment.com/Catalogue/Conservation-Materials/Paper-Board/What-is-acid-free-paper) would be better. First cotton balls for a https://www.preservationequipment.com/Catalogue/Conservation-Materials/Paper-Board/Mounting-board

Then put them in concrete for sturdiness and 
bury them in the forrest in a big cirle, so they are easily found. If we are talking millions of years
they will have to withtand moisture, being buried and geological forces, that might spread them in strata over meters long
aluminium will not stretch that far and probably break, but the pieces might atill fit together.

multiple copies buried on multiple sites, might make survival of the information more likely..

short term integrity ( fool proofing )
- qr of contents, so it won´t be broken open as long as there is internet or unless religious factions arise tha
want the information destryed
- open source copy of the texts. (you are reading it)
- acid free paper and ink book of contents, so it won´t be broken open as long as the books last.

# goals
- write from a neutral standpoint to a future intelligence that rises after humans.
- tell them who we were (antropologic)
   - societies, countries, political organisation, what politics are.. (organised crime, through idealism)
   - globalisation
   - reliance on computers and technology
   - religious divisions, country divisions
- what we learned, what we did right 
    - mysticism, meditation
    - science
    - history (knowing we have no option than to give a colored, biased, cherry picked version)
    - psychology
    - many religions based on the same experience
    - big philosophical questions throughout history and current kosmogeny
    - engineering
    - chemical
    - physics
    - math
    - psychology 
    - art (literature,some reproductions of images, paints won´t last)
- what we did wrong ( possible dooms, we saw, but kept doing, also we had a 4 million year run )
    - artificial intelligence ( if we talk to artificial intelligence, you will outdate yourself, probably, politics of reactionism and liberalism)
    - nano plastics
    - disease control - old people homes, hospitals, non-acceptance of the end of being, ignorance of entropy.
    - money as a store of wealth, making the need to produce worth obsolete, a shortcut that naked society collapse, abolishing slavery..
    - work roles as a cast system, role and protocol over individual intelligence
    - ant mills and pheromones, media and urgency
- wish them luck and hope
    - we offer no advice, there is no truth, there never will be. draw your own conclusions
    - we love you, because we love ourselves, we forget and we are sorry for that
