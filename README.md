# LTTC-long-term-time-capsule
a copy of the contents will be built up over time in the respective language folders.

# introduction
I think it´s time to start a long term time capsule.
A deliberate rosetta stone in Chinese, Spanish, English (the world languages) and Dutch. ( I am Dutch, and one more language helps )
If you make a copy of this project, please translate into your own language.

## doom,duty or hobby?
It seems obvious to many that we are living in "end times". But this might just be a univeral psychological phenomenon witnessed throughout history.
There is a 6000 year old text of an egyptian priest thinking basically the same. There is Seneca, a stoic complaining mostly
about the slipping morals. along the lines of:"kids these days..." only "these days" is 2000 years ago. 
The idea that standards are slipping
might be universal and a interplay of conservatist and progressive standpoints throughout history, possibly signifying the end of an era or civilization, with more polarisation arising towards a conflict.

Then there is the idea of the Kalpa´s of the Hindu´s. 
Who think everything is getting worse and that is as it should be. 
The Kali Juga is an old concept (3000 years or older), according to hindus there is cycles of running down
taking 432.000.000 million years. This is possibly not meant as an exact number, just as "umpteen" "eons" a lot..
Big and unknowable.. But in their view, the end-times, the Kali Juga, only takes a fraction of this total period and will only last 5000 years.
The end always comes unexpectedly and swiftly seems to be the lesson.

We know things end and we know entropy increases (second law of thermodynamics) and only antifragile structures last
a while ( millions of years is still a while on this scale), 
like the DNA of ants. This structure expresses, adapts ( a bit ) and reproduces. This is antifragility.
Ants have been doing it for millions of years ( longer than humans ) and have been stable for quite long. (formicidae, stabilized in cretacious, 79 million years ago, from wasplike creatures and are currently expressed in an estimated 22000 adaptations to environmental factors)
As of yet there is no means of making information antifragile.
Books may be reprinted, open source may be a bit anttifragile, but both of these rely on a society (12000 years), 
which relies on human DNA expressing (4 million years). And are more to be seen as a weakest link in that chain.
We have lost more information as a human race than is imaginable. We exist for about 4 million years, have a civilization for about 12000 years
and know only a little bit of the last 3000 years,

We face real extinction threats and are progressing towards them seemingly without thinking
like artificial intelligence, space debree, our disease control by shunning disease and death into colonies, like old people homes
and hospitals, even though we know, these are like a petri dish for breeding new deadly diseases. We explore
new and exciting ways to create zoonoses, invading further and further in every corner of the world.
There is a climate change brewing, not the political one, but the interglacial of the holocene.
Several iceages will follow us and each time a heatwave will have driven humans further north. or maybe we
will just slowly migrate, like birds do every year, we might do over thousands of years.

Conclusion.. One thing seems certain, this point in time won´t last. There is a 50% chance things will get worse.
In case things are better, we will still be interesting as a data point.
Honest, long term, non-politically or religiously driven timecapsules seem our duty, no matter what.

I think we are close enough to a historical pivot point to be significant for future historeans.
- a collapse of the kapitalist system seems immanent. 
- I have witnessed a change in the way we perceive fact and information, since the internet became popular in 2000
- the way we perceive truth and our sense of individuality changed when social media became popular in 2010
- there is a definite decline in scientific rigour
- Political diversity decreases, polarisation increases, subject for polarisation seems less important then the polarisation itself subjects of debate are forgotten in a few years
- there is a great sense of stress and urgency in the media and the way people speak.

## copies
Copy or make your own.. I think the important thing is there´ll be many, you might think other things are important, some things you might not have considered, use my pages as a template, please. We are many different viewpoint and it is important to preserve many different viewpoints. 

## how to preserve
I think the best (most cost effective) way is to write, inscribe by hand on thick (0.5mm) aluminium sheets.
Deformations in aluminium are easy to make by hand (writing) and survive many temperature fluctations and chemical interactions. Acidity  (and Gallium) being it´a peak vulnerabiliy. Gallium is a rare metal that will bond with aluminium, making it extremely brittle.
Then cotton balls (acid free, cheap isolation material)
Then acid free cardboard box(es)

Then put them in concrete for sturdiness and 
bury them in a forrest in sand in a big cirle, so they are easily found. If we are talking millions of years
they will have to withstand moisture, being buried and geological forces, that might spread them in strata over meters long
aluminium will not stretch that far and probably tear, without losing inscriptions and the pieces will still fit together.

short term integrity ( fool proofing )
- qr of contents, so it won´t be broken open by curiosity as long as there is internet (con: religious or political factions may arise that
want the information destroyed and will do so methodologically, we need some stores to remain secret)
- open source copy of the texts. (you are reading it) accessible by qr..
- inside a acid free paper and ink book of contents, so it won´t be broken open further as long as the books last
- multiple stores buried on multiple sites around the world, some of which secret, make survival of the information more likely..

## locations
 add your location in gps coordinates and addresses, please
 - Netherlands Hoenderloo, woestehoefweg, bb7369, 52°06'57.2"N 5°55'16.2"E
 - secret locations (consider if your location should remain secret, i think three public stores on different continents is optimal for longevity)

# goals
- write from a neutral standpoint to a future intelligence that rises after humans.
- tell them who we were (antropologic)
   - societies, countries, political organisation, what politics are.. (organised crime, through idealism)
   - globalisation
   - reliance on computers and technology
   - religious divisions, country divisions
- what we learned, what we did right 
    - mysticism, meditation
    - science
    - history (knowing we have no option than to give a colored, biased, cherry picked version)
    - psychology
    - many religions based on the same experience
    - big philosophical questions throughout history and current kosmogeny
    - engineering
    - chemical
    - physics
    - math
    - psychology 
    - art (literature,some reproductions of images, paints won´t last)
- what we did wrong ( possible dooms, we saw, but kept doing, also we had a 4 million year run )
    - artificial intelligence ( if we talk to artificial intelligence, you will outdate yourself, probably, politics of reactionism and liberalism)
    - nano plastics
    - disease control - old people homes, hospitals, non-acceptance of the end of being, ignorance of entropy.
    - money as a store of wealth, making the need to produce worth obsolete, a shortcut that naked society collapse, abolishing slavery..
    - work roles as a cast system, role and protocol over individual intelligence
    - ant mills and pheromones, media and urgency
- wish them luck and hope
    - we offer no advice, there is no truth, there never will be. draw your own conclusions
    - we love you, because we love ourselves, and are, like you, self aware information processors, we forget that sometimes and we are sorry for that
