There is no truth, just viewpoints. This is why we attempt to disclose our biases.

# theories and facts, measurements
- There are long standing scientific theaories + 50 years
- there are shortstanding scientific facts and theories, based on improving meaurements  <50 years
  (current average halflife of facts +/- 7 years)
- measurements , some, likethe speed of light in vacuum stand longer

There is a thing called significance, which indicates an estimated error-margin. like 100 +/- 50
10 means +/- 5
or 3.03 which is meant as 3.03 +/- 0.005, where 3.0003 means +/- 0.00005

Relativity of scientific data
scientific measurement is either
- a way of creating a repeatable experiment controlling the environment  in vitro, not in vivo.. 
- statistics, large number of datapoints to find trends, correlation, averages and filter out measuring mistakes.
- models, purely mathmatical models that mimic observed behaviour and are assumed to have similarworking principles 
- relies on math and numbers, which rely on solid state behaviour

These methods are used to exclude subjective experience as much as possible, but these are highly reductive of "the real world"
which tends to be chaotic and undulatory  in nature, the writer is an emergentist, not ascientist.
These tools are considered by many to be the best we have, the writer tends to see where they fail, but agreees with that standpoint.

The writer is called "Jens Hjalmar Snoep", "Hjalmar" to friends. J.H. Snoep to officials and enemies.
Human, being.. Humans are in no objective measure currently the dominant species, except in the ability to consider itself dominant, be self aware, the ability to strategize, process information and augment our environment and bodies by technology and empathise with other humans mostly. 
These we call our qualities.
Date of birth 1972/11/12
He is cis-male, Dutch (one of 17,59 million people), 50 years old (current average age in Netherlands: 42,4 current life expectancy: 84) white/kaukasian (although he personally does not believe the concepts race, age or gender to matter, and names are social structures to promote indivicduality, it is how others would describe him)
He has been educated to the level of M.A. Master of Art, an international standard equivalent to "ing". Has been measured to be of more than average intelligence and has a very good memory and is still of sound mind.

He considers himself one viewpoint among many other possible accurate ones and undoubtedly unconciously biologically and historically biased, 
but feels himself able to convey information in spite of all that as long as he attempts to convey his biases along with the viewpoint.
